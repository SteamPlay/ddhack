# DDHack #
A DLL to wrap DirectDraw to modern APIs.

## What? ##

DirectDraw was Microsoft's "gaming" 2d api in DirectX prior to DX8, and a successor to the WinG API.

Since DirectDraw has been deprecated, its support has been in the decline. However, many old games depend on the API.

The aim for this project is to let people play these old games on modern systems, and furthermore to do so without having to jump through crazy hoops (like switching to single monitor 256 color mode).
